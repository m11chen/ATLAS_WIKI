## System Requirements

The ATLAS slave node contains of a Linux workstation PC and an Ixia host PC for controlling the Traffic Generator (TG). Operation of the Ixia TG depends on Windows Dynamically-Linked Libraries of IxExplorer, so the Ixia TG host requires a Windows environment. Hence, an Ubuntu  operating system running inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is recommended as a dual system integrated slave node PC. It is also possible to use the WSL environment independently or a pure Ubuntu Linux environment as the workstation; a second dedicated Windows PC installed with IxExplorer and SSH server may be used as the TG host.

## Ubuntu Linux Workstation Setup

This section guides you through the process of setting up a Ubuntu environment as the slave node workstation. If you are running a pure Linux environment, skip ahead to the [install Java and Python dependencies](#installing-java-and-python-dependencies) section.

## Installing Ubuntu WSL on Windows 10

The core developers and test engineers for ATLAS use Ubuntu 20.04 running on Windows 10 WSL2 as the workstation. In order to setup this environment, it is necessary to update Windows to the Insider Preview version and upgrade the WSL kernel. Follow these instructions to upgrade Windows and install the latest WSL2 environment.

## Ixia Windows Host Setup

As of May 2020, ATLAS support for using a pure Windows slave node is deprecated. To setup the Windows environment for hosting the Ixia traffic generator APIs, only follow the steps in the "Installing Ixia Explorer" and "Installing Bitvise SSH Server" sections.

## Installing Ixia Explorer

If Ixia Explorer is not already installed on your Windows host, Obtain and run the Ixia Explorer installation executable corresponding to the version supported by the traffic generator in your test environment.

## Installing Bitvise SSH Server

The Ixia TG host communicates with the workstation through SSH. If using a WSL environment as the workstation, both the workstation and TG host requires installation of the Bitvise SSH server. If using a pure Linux workstation, then only install Bitvise on the TG host. Follow these steps to install Bitvise SSH server and add a Windows virtual user account:

1. Install Bitvise SSH Server.
    * Run the Bitvise SSH server setup file in the ./dependencies/win32/ directory.
2. After installation completes, open the Bitvise SSH Server Control Panel.
3. Click on "Open easy settings".
4. Select the "Virtual accounts" tab.
5. Click the "Add" button.
6. Enter a user name for the "Virtual account. (default username is "accuser")
7. Click "Virtual account password" and Type in a password for the account. (default password is "accuser")
8. Check the box for "Login allowed".
9. Check the box for "Allow file transfer".
10. For the "Shell access type" combo-box, select "Command Prompt"
11. for "Virtual filesystem layout", select "Allow full access".
12. Enter the path for the "Root directory"; the default path is:
    ```
    C:\Users\BvSsh_VirtualUsers
    ```
13. Click "Ok".
14. Click "Save changes" to close the Easy Settings dialog.
